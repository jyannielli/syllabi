COL 370 / HIST 211

Spring 2014

Tuesday and Thursday, 1.10-2.30pm

***Digital History***

***Instructor:*** Joseph Yannielli

<jyannielli@wesleyan.edu>

***Office Hours:*** Tuesday and Thursday, by appointment

***Course Description:*** This course is an introduction and critical
examination of the emerging field of digital history. Digital history is
related to the new and vibrant field of digital humanities, which has
taken the academy by storm. The term "digital humanities" (DH) refers to
the application of computing techniques to traditional humanities
disciplines. This new field has implications for teaching and research,
as well as for the presentation of cultural artifacts to the scholarly
and general public. Digital humanists employ a wide-ranging set of
techniques from text and data-mining to network analysis, topic modeling
and 3D visualizations and animation. DH is also a highly collaborative
field, and has sponsored far-flung interactions among scholars and
students from disciplines that have traditionally been relatively
isolated from one another.

Narrowing some of the broad questions raised by digital humanists, this
course will take a disciplinary focus. It will examine traditional
questions pertinent to historical study and will ask how or whether they
have been reconfigured by new media and new applications of computing
power. How do we evaluate truth claims in this new environment? Does the
change in the mode of historical representation also change the types of
questions and research we do? Has the web flattened the differences
between public and scholarly history (and do these distinctions make
sense)? How do digital tools enable new approaches to traditional fields
such as scholarly editing?

***Course Structure:*** This seminar has a theoretical and a practical
side. The first half of the course provides an overview of current
debates and methodologies in the field of digital history. Assignments
for this portion of the course include scholarly books and articles,
weekly blog entries, and site reviews. Classroom activities will help to
build and assess digital literacy skills. The second half of the course
focuses on hands-on experience and draws on the insights and abilities
learned during the first half. The result will be a collaborative
database project. Grades will be determined as follows:

Attendance and Participation……………………….30%

Reading Responses………………………………....30%

Site Review……………………………...………….10%

Final Project…………………………………….......30%

***Required Books:***

Daniel J. Cohen and Roy Rosenzweig, *Digital History: A Guide to
Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web* (University
of Pennsylvania Press, 2006)

Roy Rosenzweig, *Clio Wired: The Future of the Past in the Digital Age*
(Columbia University Press, 2011)

***Supplementary Books:***

James Boyle, *The Public Domain: Enclosing the Commons of the Mind*
(Yale University Press, 2008)

Jack Dougherty and Kristen Nawrotzki (eds.), *Writing History in the
Digital Age* (University of Michigan Press, 2013)

Matthew K Gold (ed.), *Debates in the Digital Humanities* (University of
Minnesota Press, 2012)

*All books are available for FREE on the open web or through the
library.*

***Assignments:***

*Reading Responses*: You will need to compose a reading response **each
week** during the first half of the course. Choose two details that
surprised or intrigued you and write a paragraph on each (maximum 500
words). Both details cannot be from the same source. These will be
graded as miniature essays. Think creatively – do not be afraid to state
your opinion or reference outside material. To receive full credit, your
response should be appropriately titled, categorized, and tagged. Post
your response to the course blog (<http://col370.blogs.wesleyan.edu>) by
**midnight** on Monday.

*Site Review*: You will need to post at least one review of a major
digital history project or database (minimum 1,000 words). You can
choose any one of the websites mentioned in the reading assignments or
select another site in consultation with me. Reviews should evaluate
methodological strengths and weaknesses and should place the project in
conversation with one or more of the course readings. For inspiration,
check out some of the website reviews in the [*Journal of American
History*](http://www.journalofamericanhistory.org/search_results.html?cx=007957638080440276852%3Agvfvaaijwei&cof=FORID%3A9&ie=UTF-8&q=%22web+site+review%22&sa=Search&siteurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalofamericanhistory.org%2F).
Reviews can be posted to the course blog at any time before **March
25**.

*Final Project*: The final component of this course is a collaborative
digital history project. The goal will be to select, organize, and
interpret a body of original source material. We will divide into
smaller working groups, each of which will contribute a tangible product
to the larger effort. During this time, you will track your progress and
coordinate activities on the course blog. The nature and scope of this
project will depend upon the particular interests and abilities of the
class.

***Late Policy and Academic Integrity:***

I expect all course work to be turned in on time. Late assignments will
be penalized 10 points for every 24 hours past the deadline and a note
from your dean or medical professional is necessary for any exceptions.
Evidence of plagiarism or other violations of the honor code will be
taken very seriously.

***Students with Disabilities:***

It is the policy of Wesleyan University to provide reasonable
accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Students,
however, are responsible for registering with Disabilities Services, in
addition to making requests known to us in a timely manner. If you
require accommodations in this class, please make an appointment with us
as soon as possible during the third week of the semester, so that
appropriate arrangements can be made. The procedures for registering
with Disabilities Services can be found at:
