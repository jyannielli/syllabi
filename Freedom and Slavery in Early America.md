***Freedom and Slavery in Early America***

***Instructor:*** Joseph Yannielli ***Office Hours:*** Monday and
Wednesday

> <jyannielli@wesleyan.edu> by appointment

***Course Description:*** This course explores major themes in Early
American History through the lens of freedom and slavery (and the many
shades in between). Topics include Native American slavery, enslaved
Africans and Atlantic Creoles, the development of gender and racial
hierarchies, popular protest, and the radicalism of the American
Revolution. Coursework and discussion will focus on the analysis of
primary source material (diaries, manifestos, petitions, paintings,
newspaper articles, advertisements) and the interpretive frameworks
offered by various historians.

***Course Structure:*** This course meets twice during the week. As a
general rule, Mondays will set the stage with a work of historical
analysis and Wednesdays will follow up with a close reading of a primary
text or texts. Grades will be determined as follows:

Attendance and Participation……………………….20%

Reading Responses…………………………………20%

Class Presentation…………………………………..20%

Research Paper……………………………………...40%

***Assignments:***

*Weekly Reading Responses*: You will need to pose at least two
discussion questions each week, based on the assigned reading. These
should be no more than a paragraph in length (maximum 500 words) and
should highlight a particular issue or problem in the text that
surprised or intrigued you. When there is more than one reading, at
least one of your questions should pertain to a different source. These
will be graded as miniature essays. Think critically – pose questions
that are provocative and insightful. Post your response to the class
blog
([*http://hist306.blogs.wesleyan.edu/*](http://hist306.blogs.wesleyan.edu/))
by **noon on Monday**.

*Class Presentation*: Select a week that holds special interest for you
and prepare a 10-minute presentation to be given in class on either
Monday or Wednesday. The presentation should include background
information on the author(s) and major themes. You will be responsible
for leading the class discussion on that day.

*Final Paper*: A 2,000-3,000 word research paper on a topic of your
choice. Use a primary source (or set of sources) to evaluate and
critique the interpretive framework offered by one or more historians.
The topic need not relate to your class presentation, although that
might help. Post your topic and a preliminary bibliography of primary
and secondary sources to the class blog by **March 26**. A writing
sample of at least 500 words is due in class on **April 11**. A polished
and eloquent final draft is due by noon on **May 14.**

***Late Policy and Academic Integrity:***

I expect all assignments to be turned in on time. Late papers will be
penalized 10 points for every 24 hours past the deadline and a note from
your dean or medical professional is necessary for any exceptions.
Evidence of plagiarism or other violations of the honor code will be
taken very seriously.

It is the policy of Wesleyan University to provide reasonable
accommodations to students with documented disabilities. Students,
however, are responsible for registering with Disabilities Services, in
addition to making requests known to us in a timely manner. If you
